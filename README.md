The popular boatdance (aka "aura farming") in ASCII art form. 
# ðŸš¤ Aura Farming in ASCII

This Python script plays a fully embedded ASCII art animation of the **popular Indonesian boy who boat dances**, complete with synchronized background music â€” right inside your terminal.

No extra files are needed â€” the MP4 video and MP3 audio are already embedded directly into the script using Base64 encoding.  
Just run it, sit back, and enjoy the retro vibes.
